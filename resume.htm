						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">Developed a user interface to make it easy to edit videos using FFMPEG</li>
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">Created an application to rename digital photos according to the date &amp; time that the picture was taken instead of having them sequentially numbered</li>
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">My very first work related program was written in C for the DOS system. It was a mining simulator to find the optimum operation under capacity and power restrictions.</li>
					</ul>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3 id="AutoCAD_Software" class="content-title">AutoCAD Software Developer</h3>
					<div class="content-details">
					<ul class="bulleted">
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">Worked on the PROCAD 2D software as the sole developer and was responsible for developing new features, maintaining existing code and providing user support.</li>
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">Customization was also done to suit the specific needs of clients. The customization code was placed along side of the normal code and was unlocked with a unique client key code.</li>
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">Controlled licensing of the software with CrypKey and the software installation using InstallShield. Automated the process of getting the latest source file versions from SourceSafe, compiling the programs, building the installation, and having a folder ready to burn to CD for distribution.</li>
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">Worked with the 3D piping software team to develop the metadata code to model components from the SQL database into AutoCAD.</li>
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">Developed a 3D viewer using OpenGL to view the model components in both Windows stand-a-lone programs and AutoCAD-based programs.</li>
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">Developed custom open drawing dialog which shows drawings organized according to project along with a preview of the drawing. This makes it easy for users to quickly find drawings without having to navigate a complex network path.</li>

Inserting any engineering stamps or date stamps required before printing and removing them after the drawing has been printed. Also providing the ability to batch plot a number of drawings.</li>
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">Developed a system that ran overnight where models that were modified during the day are cleaned up with unused layers purged and settings reset to default. AutoCAD models would be incorporated into a Navisworks 3D model for walk-through viewing and uploaded to a client's FTP site so they can see the progress being made.</li>
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">Develop commands that take a number of tasks and incorporate them into a single command</li>
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">Develop and maintain a library of blocks and the commands to place them to ensure that they go on the correct layer and orientation according to the corporate drafting standards</li>
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">Custom commands are created in AutoLISP if possible. This keeps the code in an easy to edit format by any developer and also provides the most compatibility for the commands to work on all future versions of AutoCAD.</li>

					<h3 id="AutoCAD_Drafter" class="content-title">AutoCAD Drafter</h3>
					<div class="content-details">
					<ul class="bulleted">
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">While employed in the Electrical Department, drafting experience included CAD drafting of cable tray, lighting, power, grounding and MCC layouts in plan view, elevations and details</li>

					<h3 id="Unity_Developer" class="content-title">Unity Apps &amp; VR Developer</h3>
					<h3 class="content-subtitle">Training &amp; Inspection Software</h3>
					<div class="content-details">
					<ul class="bulleted">
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">Developed a VR training simulation for switching out an electrical circuit breaker rack. Users have to select the correct PPE, check area for hazards, communicate with a switchman for orders and finally perform the racking out. The system had 3 levels of training from being fully guided, to partially guided, and finally to an open world. The open world let users perform tasks in any order but they failed if performed out of order. The racking was performed with real physical equipment and a sensor attached so they would see it moving in the virtual world.</li>
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">Creating a virtual reality experience for inspecting large mining equipment. Made the controls for users to teleport around the equipment, inspecting parts, identifying hazards and interacting by opening doors. To aid the users, arrows were placed on the ground to guide them to the next inspection location. Also a robot was animated to demonstrate the controls and inspection procedure. This was with the Oculus Rift system while a stripped down version was created for the Oculus Go.</li>
					</ul>
					</div>
					<h3 class="content-subtitle">Home Decorating Software</h3>
					<div class="content-details">
					<ul class="bulleted">
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">Creating software to easily model houses in 3D. Implemented the method that each room was standalone, created on it's own and then all rooms put together like a puzzle to form the house. Focused on generating walls with commands to easily place and modify them. Implemented wall dragging to move and stretch them into position along with real-time dimensions displayed. Corners were drawn to automatically match up walls at different angles and with different thicknesses. Walls could have a sloping top line and could curve inwards or outwards. Window and door openings were improved for placement and duplication, again using dragging techniques.</li>
						<li style="page-break-inside: avoid;">The detailed manipulation of the walls required lots of triangulation calculations. A generic library was used for the creating the openings on a flat 2D surface but then faceting and extra triangulation was required to curve the surface. Also the wall needed to be made from 2 pieces for the inside and outside, end lengths extended so nice corners were created, and thicknesses shaved off to prevent interference from overlapping walls.</li>

					<h3 id="Games_Developer" class="content-title">Unity Games Developer</h3>
					<p>When I have some spare time, I enjoy creating small games and posting them on <a href= "https://dgsoftware.itch.io/" target="_blank">https://dgsoftware.itch.io</a> for people to play. Mostly I've recreated classic games like <a href="https://dgsoftware.itch.io/pong" target="_blank">Pong</a>, <a href="https://dgsoftware.itch.io/breakout" target="_blank">Breakout</a>, <a href="https://dgsoftware.itch.io/asteroids" target="_blank">Asteroids</a>, <a href="https://dgsoftware.itch.io/voxel-invaders" target="_blank">Space Invaders</a>, <a href="https://dgsoftware.itch.io/diamond-mine" target="_blank">Diamond Mine</a> and <a href="https://dgsoftware.itch.io/worst-tetris-ever" target="_blank">Tetris</a>. The <a href="https://dgsoftware.itch.io/asteroids" target="_blank">Asteroids</a> and <a href="https://dgsoftware.itch.io/voxel-invaders" target="_blank">Space Invaders</a> games are interesting as they are created from vector lines and voxel cubes which break apart differently when destroyed.</p>
					<p>I have also recreated some mobile games like <a href="https://dgsoftware.itch.io/unblockable" target="_blank">Unblockable</a> and <a href="https://dgsoftware.itch.io/ballz-alike" target="_blank">Ballz-alike</a>. They are relatively easy games to make but with different game mechanics. My <a href="https://dgsoftware.itch.io/versus-2d2pg" target="_blank">Versus 2D2PG</a> is a collection of 2D games for 2 players to be played with gamepad controllers.</p>
					<p>I also enjoy taking computer games and putting them into VR. The <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/tower-defense-template-107692" target="_blank">Unity Tower Defense Template</a> is a really immersive experience when played in VR. You can play with a view of the entire map or put yourself right down in the action with the battle all around you. My <a href="https://dgsoftware.itch.io/shooting-gallery" target="_blank">Shooting Gallery</a> is fun to play on the computer but better played in VR. I'm hoping to one day bring it to Android with lots of new features and gameplay.</p>
